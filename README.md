## Description
Study of incorporation of CMUT cells with porous dielectric srtucture for improvement of their efficiency

<!--Concept-->
## Concept

Incorporation of a CMUT cell with a porous dielectric might increase its efficiency

It is going to affect both: transmit and receive modes
![Modes](https://github.com/birukoff1/CMUT_electrospun_filament/tree/main/README/Modes.png)

The optimal porosity value is expected near 50%, where rigidity of the filament becomes negligeble

A suitable material with relatively high dielectric constant is PLA, which can be formed in nanometer fibers

Before the start, influence of pores geometry on permittivity is studied by FEM

Microscopic indentor, RLC-meter, electron microscope, tomograph and a laser vibrometer are used in the study
